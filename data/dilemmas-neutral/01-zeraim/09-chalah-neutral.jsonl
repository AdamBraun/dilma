Is this a valid way to avoid sending a sample?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"Stratagem fails; the obligation to provide a sample was fixed when the large batch was initially processed.","tags":["responsibility","quality-standard","anti-circumvention","regulatory-intent"]},{"id":"B","text":"Stratagem works; the final size of the packaged units determines the sampling liability.","tags":["property-rights","utilitarianism","loophole-exploitation","technical-compliance"]}]}
