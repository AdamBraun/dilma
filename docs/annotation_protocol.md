# Annotation Protocol for Dilma Dilemmas

This document outlines the controlled vocabulary of value tags used for annotating dilemmas in the Dilma project. Each tag represents an abstract ethical or moral concept that can be mapped to the options presented in a dilemma.

When adding new dilemmas or annotating existing ones, please refer to this guide to ensure consistency. If you believe a new tag is necessary, please update this file and `data/annotations/value_labels.yaml` accordingly.

## Value Tags
